        <p>I hear something hanging on the wind</p>

        <p>I see black smoke up around the bend</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The girl ran through the halls of the deserted building, desperately
        trying to reach him. Before the clock ran out of time. And still, the
        ticking of the clock grew louder.
      </p>

      <p>10...</p>

      <p>9....</p>

      <div class="lyric1">
        <p>The leaves have changed a time or two</p>

        <p>Since the last time the train came through</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        She heard screaming over the sound of wailing sirens. The firefighters
        were trying to reach the fire, but she knew they wouldn't make it. She
        realized then that the voice screaming was hers.
      </p>

      <p>8...</p>

      <p>7...</p>

      <div class="lyric1">
        <p>My father's father's blood is on the track</p>

        <p>A sweet refrain drifts from the past</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The flames licked at her clothes, greedy to devour all. But the flames
        never truly touched her, disappearing as they came close. She knew she
        was nearly there. Nearly to the room where it had all started, all those
        years ago.
      </p>

      <p>6...</p>

      <p>5...</p>

      <div class="lyric1">
        <p>The winding roads that led me here</p>

        <p>Burn like coal and dry like tears</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        She reached the room. He was there, on the ground, in the midst of the
        fire that would raze the building to the ground. She ran forward,
        desperate to dissipate the flames. To save him, like he had saved her so
        long ago.
      </p>

      <p>4...</p>

      <p>3...</p>

      <div class="lyric1">
        <p>So here's my hope</p>

        <p>My tired soul</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        A blast echoed through the burning halls. The flames turned blue,
        stronger than before. They no longer dissipated when they touched the
        girl. The inferno raced to the room, where she turned to face the
        flames, screaming in pain.
      </p>

      <div class="lyric1">
        <p>So here's my ticket</p>

        <p>I want to go home...</p>
      </div>

      <p>1...</p>

      <p>
        The flames swallowed him, skipping over her. She could only watch as
        they devoured him, and when they were done, they turned on her. She knew
        she'd lost. She'd had her chance.
      </p>

      <p>0â€¦</p>

      <div class="lyric1">
        <p>Home...</p>

        <p>Home...</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Gasping, she woke up, drenched in sweat, tears falling down her face.
        She'd had to relive that moment again and again, each time waking before
        she died in ice and fire. Getting up, she went to his room, where he
        opened the door before she'd even knocked.
      </p>

      <p>
        "It's okay. It was just a nightmare, little sis. I'm right here. I'm
        okay. You saved me. You saved me, Soul." he said, hugging her.
