        There will always come a time when people must be the first to begin
        creating the change they wish to see. Florence Nightingale taught the
        people in her world to see it as she did; a world where everyone could
        access medical assistance regardless of their position in life.
        Nightingale grew up in a wealthy family. She was expected to grow up,
        marry, and have children. This was not to be. In 1837, Nightingale felt
        that she had been sent a mission by God to help others. This led to her
        resolve to become a nurse, despite the social stigma of the job.
        Nightingale spent some time touring workhouses, and when she visited one
        in particular in the 1840s, she resolved to make a difference.
        Regardless of her parents’ protests, she attended nursing schools and
        became a superintendent at the Institute for the Care of Sick
        Gentlewomen upon her return. Later, she was sent to Crimea, where she
        took charge of the hospitals and proved to the officers that although
        she was a woman in a man’s world, she could do her job well. Despite
        falling ill during her time there, she continued her work influencing
        officials to pass reforms that would benefit the general population. Her
        hard work made her the first woman to receive the Order of Merit, having
        been awarded it by King Edward VII. She was also awarded the Royal Red
        Cross by Queen Victoria. She worked tirelessly, putting aside her own
        health to help those poorer than her and to remove obstacles concerning
        health care from their way. Florence Nightingale, a nurse who pioneered
        numerous health reforms, proved she is a deserving hero because of her
        selflessness and ambitiousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Florence Nightingale’s selflessness was accentuated by her need to fix
        the problems she perceived in the world she lived in. During the war in
        Crimea, Nightingale was elected to lead a group of nurses to help the
        hospital there. While there, she struggled with a rapidly spreading
        cholera outbreak, but sources said that “Nightingale made it her mission
        to improve hygiene practices, significantly lowering the death rate at
        the hospital in the process. The hard work took a toll on her health”
        (“Florence Nightingale”, History.com). Despite the challenge of aiding
        sick soldiers and grappling with a sickness that spread too quickly to
        contain, Nightingale continued to fight. Her selfless nature was a
        characteristic not customarily seen in her time. While others would have
        given up and moved on, relieving themselves of unnecessary pressure, she
        pushed on. As she battled hardship after hardship, her dedication never
        wavered. Her willingness to ignore her own health indicates her
        dedication to her mission to help others. Putting others before oneself
        is a commonly perceived heroic trait as it demonstrates selflessness and
        willingness to aid others not matter the circumstances, which is a trait
        that Nightingale certainly possessed. Although she contracted “Crimean
        Fever”, as a result of which she was bedridden for the rest of her life,
        she remained: “[…] dedicated as ever to improving health care and
        alleviating patients’ suffering, [and] continued her work from her bed”
        (“Florence Nightingale”, Biography.com). Although Nightingale was ill
        and could not continue her work as a nurse as she had previously, she
        continued to work from the sidelines. In direct contrast to how many
        would have responded to being bedridden, she continued working for the
        good of others rather than herself. Nightingale’s actions demonstrated
        her strong-willed character, as well as her ability to give to others
        without looking for repayment as she continued her work, ignoring her
        own needs and personal struggles. The selflessness Nightingale displayed
        in the time she lived in and struggles she faced mark her a hero for
        all.

        Florence Nightingale had ambitions that would benefit others and was
        always determined to succeed. At the time, some doctors and nurses had
        the idea of perhaps changing how things were run on a smaller scale “but
        Nightingale's vision [...] was much bolder: that the care given in the
        workhouse infirmaries should be just as good as that in the best nursed
        civil hospitals in the suburbs” (McDonald). She moved against society’s
        standards and pushed towards the reality of equal healthcare for all.
        The infirmaries were subpar, and often those at workhouses did not have
        proper care. Nightingale had noticed this during one of her visits and
        sought to fix the problem. This was not viewed as a problem for many,
        and others often scorned her attempts to improve healthcare.
        Nevertheless, she pushed on relentlessly, working to alleviate problems
        the rest of Britain turned a blind eye on. Others would rather ignore
        the problems that do not concern them, but Nightingale did not. Her
        ambitiousness to improve the quality of life others had was something
        rarely seen in. Her work was not only limited to workhouse infirmaries:
        “Her statistical research influenced reforms in hospital administration
        and design […] as well as reforms in hygiene and health care for the
        poor” (Jenkins). Nightingale was ambitious but focused on helping the
        poor. Few in Britain at the time were willing to use their own wealth
        and time to help those considered beneath them. Nightingale, on the
        other hand, not only used her wealth and time, she threw herself into
        her work. She used never before seen methods to find what was wrong with
        hospitals and improve them. Her methods included statistics, a skill
        that at the time was not considered feminine. Her actions set precedents
        as she continued to reform a badly damaged system. Although
        ambitiousness itself is perhaps not heroic, Nightingale used her
        ambitions to aid others, which is the sign of a true hero.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nightingale’s fiercely ambitious nature and selfless actions made a
        strong case in the defense of her heroism. Her pushes for reforms in
        health care and hospital sanitation showed an ambition that was unheard
        of for women in her time. She paid attention to matters that were
        considered insignificant and struggled to show the world that all
        deserved equal care. Nightingale developed new methods for analysis, an
        action that many deemed pointless for a woman. However, she, unlike many
        of the wealthy, worked hard and pushed aside her own desires to aid
        those who needed it. Her actions are a true inspiration to others,
        working to show them that change in society is achievable. Despite the
        tremendous odds she faced, she continued to do what was right in a world
        where men held all of the power. She demonstrated that women can possess
        both power and influence if they do not turn back when times are rough.
        Nightingale utilized the skills she possessed and had gained through
        personal struggles to help others in ways that could barely be imagined
        in her time, marking her as a deserving hero.
